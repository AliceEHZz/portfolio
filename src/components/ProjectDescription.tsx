			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center">Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Embarking on the journey to redesign the website for BWI Business World
				Inc., a Vancouver-based wholesale supplier with a rich 23-year history,
				was not just a project; it was a challenge I eagerly accepted. My goal
				was to rejuvenate BWI&rsquo;s online presence, transforming it into a
				beacon of user-friendliness and modern design principles.
			</p>

			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center">Problem Identification</h2>
			<p>
				From my first interaction with BWI&rsquo;s original website, it was
				clear that despite the company&rsquo;s impressive credentials, the
				site&rsquo;s user experience was lacking. Navigational issues in the
				menu bars, overlaid texts and images, and outdated aesthetics not only
				hampered usability but can often also impact a business&rsquo;s image.
				After recognizing these issues, I was motivated to bring about changes
				with notable front-end issues.
			</p>

			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center">
				The Development Journey
			</h2>
			<p>
				My plan for BWI was a website that epitomizes clarity, ease of
				navigation, and responsiveness. Leveraging a tech stack of Next.js,
				React, and Tailwind CSS, I aimed to craft an interface that feels both
				inviting and intuitive to every visitor, whether they&rsquo;re on
				desktop or mobile. The choice of Next.js was driven by its SEO
				advantages and server-side rendering capabilities, React&rsquo;s
				component-based architecture facilitated rapid development, and Tailwind
				CSS allowed for custom, responsive design without the overhead of
				writing custom CSS.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project wasn&rsquo;t just about coding; it was a holistic design
				approach. Starting with a Figma prototype allowed me to iterate on user
				feedback early in the process to ensure the final product wouldn&rsquo;t
				just meet but exceed user expectations.
			</p>

			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center">
				Enhancements and Outcomes
			</h2>
			<div className="mt-4">
				<Link href="/images/website-redesign/compare.png">
					<Image
						src="/images/website-redesign/compare.png"
						alt="Pictok Home"
						width={1000}
						height={1000}
					/>
				</Link>
			</div>

			<p>With meticulous attention to detail, I introduced:</p>

			<ul className="list-disc ml-6">
				<li>A serene, minimalist design to enhance readability.</li>
				<li>
					A reimagined navigation structure, making information discovery
					effortless.
				</li>
				<li>
					An interactive homepage banner, creating engaging entry points to key
					sections.
				</li>
				<li>
					Distinct delineations between different product categories,
					streamlining the user journey.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The site was optimized for mobile users to ensure a seamless experience
				across all devices.
			</p>
			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center">
				Reflections and Learnings
			</h2>
			<p>
				This project was a profound learning opportunity which underlines the
				importance of user-centered design and the power of visual simplicity.
				Facing challenges like simplifying complex content layouts taught me
				resilience and the value of iterative testing. Looking ahead, I&rsquo;m
				excited to apply these insights to future projects, continually
				improving my craft.
			</p>
			<p>
				Looking back, I see avenues for further improvement, such as deeper A/B
				testing for user interaction and expanding the site&rsquo;s footer for
				enhanced engagement. These are not just tasks but opportunities for
				growth and refinement. Additionally, I recognize the importance of speed
				improvements to ensure optimal performance for all users, especially
				those accessing the site on mobile devices. Scalability is also a
				crucial consideration to accommodate future growth and increased
				traffic.
			</p>
			<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				Redesigning BWI&rsquo;s website was a challenge in my professional
				development. It provides invaluable experience in tackling real-world
				web design challenges. In addition, it stands as a testament to my
				commitment to excellence through development and my relentless pursuit
				of user satisfaction. As I move forward, I&rsquo;m eager to bring this
				dedication and insight to new projects, pushing boundaries and creating
				memorable online experiences.
